# Troubleshooting

## Purpose

This guide covers the current `v2` `HttpData-PULL` execution path. Start with [Getting Started](getting-started.md), then use the flow-specific guide:

- [Ingestion API](flows/ingestion-api.md)
- [WFS](flows/wfs.md)
- [SPARQL](flows/sparql.md)

Do not paste passwords, tokens, API keys, EDR authorization, connector hosts, or raw evidence into support requests.

## Diagnostic principles

Before changing state:

1. identify the last phase whose status is `ok`;
2. identify the expected `SUFFIX`;
3. use the run-specific `summary.json` and phase artifacts;
4. confirm that every sourced phase environment has the same `SUFFIX`;
5. inspect `.http`, redacted JSON, and attempt-summary files before raw payloads;
6. stop when a prerequisite phase has failed.

`runtime/env/latest/` is mutable convenience state. The historical source of truth is:

```text
evidencias/runs/${SUFFIX}/
```

## Environment and repository setup

### Issue: a phase cannot find the repository root

**Symptom**

The script reports that it cannot find the API root or a required repository file.

**Likely cause**

- The command is running outside the cloned repository.
- The checkout is incomplete.
- The script was copied away from the repository instead of executed in place.

**Checks**

```bash
pwd
test -f endpoints.sh
test -f export_suffix.sh
test -f scripts/lib_common.sh
```

**Corrective action**

Change to the repository root and run the original script from `scripts/`. Restore missing tracked files from the repository rather than recreating them manually.

### Issue: Bash or required commands are unavailable

**Symptom**

The shell reports syntax errors around associative arrays or name references, or the script reports that `curl` or `jq` is unavailable.

**Likely cause**

- Bash is older than 4.3.
- The selected `BASH_BIN` is incorrect.
- A required command is not installed or not on `PATH`.

**Checks**

```bash
bash_bin="${BASH_BIN:-$(command -v bash)}"
"${bash_bin}" --version
command -v curl
command -v jq
command -v python3
```

**Corrective action**

Install or select Bash 4.3 or newer, `curl`, and `jq`. Python 3 is recommended for claim diagnostics. Re-run the failed phase with the corrected Bash executable.

### Issue: connector network access fails

**Symptom**

Phase 0 reports name-resolution, connection, timeout, or TLS errors and does not produce `phase0_env.sh`.

**Likely cause**

- The configured connector network is unavailable.
- Required VPN, DNS, proxy, or routing is missing.
- The selected environment profile is not reachable from the current machine.

**Checks**

Verify network access using connector addresses supplied by the environment owner. Do not copy those addresses into public documentation or support messages.

Check that phase 0 did not complete:

```bash
test -f runtime/env/latest/phase0_env.sh
```

**Corrective action**

Restore the approved network path before retrying phase 0. Do not create a phase environment manually. Add local DNS overrides only when the infrastructure owner supplies and approves them.

## Flow and version resolution

### Issue: `IPPCP_FLOW` or `IPPCP_FLOW_VERSION` is incorrect

**Symptom**

The wrong connector configuration is loaded, a flow export is missing, or the selected asset does not match the intended resource.

**Likely cause**

- `IPPCP_FLOW` is not `ingesta` or `consumo`.
- `IPPCP_FLOW_VERSION` is not explicitly set to `v2`.
- A stale `IPPCP_FLOW_DIR`, `IPPCP_DATASPACE_DIR`, or `IPPCP_DATASPACE_FILE` overrides normal resolution.

**Checks**

```bash
printf 'dataspace=%s\n' "${IPPCP_DATASPACE:-<unset>}"
printf 'flow=%s\n' "${IPPCP_FLOW:-<unset>}"
printf 'version=%s\n' "${IPPCP_FLOW_VERSION:-<unset>}"
printf 'flow_dir=%s\n' "${IPPCP_FLOW_DIR:-<auto>}"
```

Expected current selections:

```text
IPPCP_DATASPACE=ippcp
IPPCP_FLOW=ingesta or consumo
IPPCP_FLOW_VERSION=v2
```

**Corrective action**

For a clean selection:

```bash
unset IPPCP_DATASPACE_FILE IPPCP_DATASPACE_DIR IPPCP_FLOW_DIR
export IPPCP_DATASPACE=ippcp
export IPPCP_FLOW="<ingesta-or-consumo>"
export IPPCP_FLOW_VERSION=v2
```

Then start a new phase 0. Use `ingesta` for Ingestion API and `consumo` for WFS or SPARQL.

### Issue: execution falls back to historical `test3`

**Symptom**

Context artifacts identify the `test3` dataspace or unexpected historical connectors.

**Likely cause**

`IPPCP_DATASPACE` was unset and the compatibility fallback was selected.

**Checks**

```bash
printf 'dataspace=%s\n' "${IPPCP_DATASPACE:-<unset>}"
printf 'dataspace_file=%s\n' "${IPPCP_DATASPACE_FILE:-<auto>}"
```

Inspect the phase 0 context for the current run without publishing it.

**Corrective action**

Stop the run. Explicitly set `IPPCP_DATASPACE=ippcp`, select `v2`, unset advanced directory/file overrides, and start a new execution. Do not continue a `test3` run as if it were current IPPCP.

### Issue: `runtime/env/latest` contains stale state

**Symptom**

A phase uses an unexpected asset, agreement, transfer, flow, or run identifier.

**Likely cause**

`runtime/env/latest/phaseN_env.sh` belongs to a different execution.

**Checks**

```bash
for env_file in runtime/env/latest/phase{0,1,2,3}_env.sh; do
  if [[ -f "${env_file}" ]]; then
    printf '%s: ' "${env_file}"
    awk -F= '/^export SUFFIX=/{print $2}' "${env_file}"
  fi
done
```

Compare those values with the intended run directory under `evidencias/runs/`.

**Corrective action**

Source the run-specific phase environment from the intended evidence directory, or restart from the last confirmed phase. Never edit IDs in a phase environment to force them to match.

### Issue: `SUFFIX` differs between phases

**Symptom**

Artifacts and inherited identifiers refer to different run directories, or a later phase cannot find the expected connector object.

**Likely cause**

Phase files from different executions were sourced in one shell.

**Checks**

```bash
: "${SUFFIX:?Source the intended phase environment first}"
summary="evidencias/runs/${SUFFIX}/summary.json"
jq -r '.suffix, (.phases | keys[])' "${summary}"
```

Compare `SUFFIX` in each run-specific `phaseN_env.sh`.

**Corrective action**

Stop. Open a clean shell, source only the expected run-specific phase environment, and continue from the next valid phase. If the chain cannot be proven, start a new run.

## Phase 0: context and EdD authentication

### Issue: provider or consumer credentials are missing

**Symptom**

Phase 0 reports a missing `user_provider.sh` or `user_consumer.sh`.

**Likely cause**

The ignored local credential files were not created beside the selected `v2` flow exports.

**Checks**

```bash
flow_dir="flujos/ippcp/v2/${IPPCP_FLOW}"
test -f "${flow_dir}/user_provider.sh"
test -f "${flow_dir}/user_consumer.sh"
test -f "${flow_dir}/user_provider.example.sh"
test -f "${flow_dir}/user_consumer.example.sh"
```

**Corrective action**

Copy the `.example.sh` files to the ignored names and populate them locally. Provider credentials must be valid for the configured provider connector; consumer credentials must be valid for the configured consumer connector. The file layout does not require different users for every data flow.

### Issue: EdD authentication returns no token

**Symptom**

Phase 0 reports that it could not obtain the provider or consumer JWT.

**Likely cause**

- Incorrect username or password.
- The technical user cannot complete non-interactive authentication.
- Wrong dataspace, realm, or client configuration.
- User provisioning is incomplete or disabled.

**Checks**

- Confirm the selected dataspace and flow.
- Confirm both ignored credential files exist.
- Confirm the technical users are enabled for the configured connector authentication process.
- If an earlier run exists, inspect its redacted `jwt_claims_*.json`; do not inspect or paste the token.

**Corrective action**

Correct the local credential or identity configuration and rerun phase 0. Do not use a manual token request with a password on the command line.

### Issue: one connector smoke check fails

**Symptom**

Provider or consumer asset-list smoke evidence has a non-success status.

**Likely cause**

- The corresponding technical user lacks connector permissions.
- The connector base URL belongs to another environment.
- Network access is incomplete.

**Checks**

```bash
: "${SUFFIX:?Set the phase 0 run identifier}"
cat "evidencias/runs/${SUFFIX}/phase0/01_provider_assets_smoke.http"
cat "evidencias/runs/${SUFFIX}/phase0/02_consumer_assets_smoke.http"
```

**Corrective action**

Correct the failing connector's access, role, or environment configuration. Both smoke checks must pass before phase 1.

## Phase 1: asset and offer publication

### Issue: phase 1 runs in an unsupported folder or context

**Symptom**

`ASSET_CONFIG` cannot be found, the wrong default asset is selected, or publication targets unexpected connectors.

**Likely cause**

- The command is not running from the repository root.
- `ASSET_CONFIG` is relative to another directory.
- The wrong flow/version was selected.
- `ASSET_CONFIG` was omitted.

**Checks**

```bash
pwd
test -f scripts/phase1_provider_publish.sh
test -f "${ASSET_CONFIG:-<missing>}"
printf 'flow=%s version=%s\n' "${IPPCP_FLOW:-<unset>}" "${IPPCP_FLOW_VERSION:-<unset>}"
```

**Corrective action**

Return to the repository root, source the matching `phase0_env.sh`, and set the exact `ASSET_CONFIG` from the selected [flow guide](getting-started.md#select-a-flow) before rerunning phase 1.

### Issue: asset configuration is rejected

**Symptom**

Phase 1 reports invalid JSON, missing fields, unsupported content kind/extension, an invalid base URL, or an InesDataStore configuration.

**Likely cause**

The selected file is malformed or belongs to the separate B2 baseline rather than the current `HttpData-PULL` path.

**Checks**

```bash
jq empty "${ASSET_CONFIG}"
jq '{type, content_kind, extension, media_type}' "${ASSET_CONFIG}"
```

The current phase 1 requires `type=HttpData`.

**Corrective action**

Select a current configuration from the Ingestion API, WFS, or SPARQL guide. Do not route an InesDataStore configuration through the current phase 1 script.

### Issue: publication returns HTTP 409

**Symptom**

Phase 1 reports that a resource derived from the current `SUFFIX` already exists.

**Likely cause**

The same run identifier was reused for immutable provider resources.

**Checks**

```bash
: "${SUFFIX:?Source phase0_env.sh}"
jq '.phases.phase1' "evidencias/runs/${SUFFIX}/summary.json"
```

**Corrective action**

Start a new execution with a new `SUFFIX`. The scripts do not implement provider cleanup or in-place asset mutation.

### Issue: asset or offer is absent from the provider catalog

**Symptom**

Publication calls succeed, but phase 1 cannot find the asset in the provider self-catalog.

**Likely cause**

- Policy or contract-definition publication failed.
- The asset, policy, and contract definition do not reference the same IDs.
- Catalog propagation or connector authorization failed.

**Checks**

Inspect:

```text
evidencias/runs/${SUFFIX}/phase1/
evidencias/runs/${SUFFIX}/summary.json
```

Focus on asset retrieval, contract-definition listing, self-catalog status, and catalog match.

**Corrective action**

Fix the failed publication step and start a new execution if immutable objects were partially created. Do not invent or edit connector IDs in local state.

## Phase 2: negotiation and agreement

### Issue: the catalog does not contain the expected asset

**Symptom**

Phase 2 cannot select `ASSET_ID` or an offer policy from the remote catalog.

**Likely cause**

- Phase 1 did not complete.
- A stale `phase1_env.sh` was sourced.
- Provider/consumer roles or protocol address are incorrect.
- The asset is not visible under the published contract definition.

**Checks**

```bash
: "${SUFFIX:?Source the intended phase1_env.sh}"
jq '.phases.phase1.status, .phases.phase2' "evidencias/runs/${SUFFIX}/summary.json"
```

Inspect the remote catalog and selected-ID artifacts under `phase2/`.

**Corrective action**

Resolve phase 1/catalog visibility first. Source the matching `phase1_env.sh` and rerun phase 2 only when the asset and offer are present.

### Issue: negotiation does not reach `FINALIZED` or produce an agreement

**Symptom**

Negotiation becomes `TERMINATED` or times out without `contractAgreementId`.

**Likely cause**

- Policy mismatch.
- Stale asset or offer identifiers.
- Consumer authentication expired during an external/manual operation.
- Connector notification or protocol failure.

**Checks**

Inspect the negotiation response and state polling artifacts:

```text
evidencias/runs/${SUFFIX}/phase2/30_contract_negotiation_response.json
evidencias/runs/${SUFFIX}/phase2/31_negotiation_state_*.json
evidencias/runs/${SUFFIX}/phase2/32_negotiation_final_state.json
```

The script polls up to 20 times with three-second intervals. The implemented success gate is a valid agreement ID. A `FINALIZED` display state is not sufficient without that ID, and a valid agreement ID can complete the implemented gate even when state reporting differs.

**Corrective action**

Correct the policy, asset selection, or connector issue. `PHASE2_FORCE=1` is implemented only to relaunch phase 2 when `phase2_env.sh` already contains an agreement for the same `SUFFIX`; it creates another negotiation. Use it only after reviewing the existing run.

### Issue: phase 2 refuses to relaunch

**Symptom**

The script reports that `phase2_env.sh` already contains `AGREEMENT_ID` for the current run.

**Likely cause**

Duplicate negotiation protection detected completed phase 2 state.

**Checks**

```bash
: "${SUFFIX:?Source phase1_env.sh}"
jq '.phases.phase2' "evidencias/runs/${SUFFIX}/summary.json"
```

**Corrective action**

Continue to phase 3 if the agreement is valid. If a deliberate new negotiation is required for the same run, execute phase 2 with `PHASE2_FORCE=1`. This is not a cleanup or rollback mechanism.

## Phase 3: transfer and EDR

### Issue: transfer does not reach `STARTED` or `COMPLETED`

**Symptom**

Phase 3 times out, or the transfer becomes `TERMINATED` or `ERROR`.

**Likely cause**

- Invalid agreement or provider protocol address.
- Transfer request rejected by a connector.
- Connector/Data Plane availability problem.

**Checks**

Inspect:

```text
evidencias/runs/${SUFFIX}/phase3/10_transfer_response.json
evidencias/runs/${SUFFIX}/phase3/20_transfer_state_*.json
evidencias/runs/${SUFFIX}/phase3/21_transfer_final_state.json
```

The script polls up to 20 times with three-second intervals. The implemented accepted states are `STARTED` and `COMPLETED`.

**Corrective action**

Correct the underlying transfer failure. `PHASE3_FORCE=1` is implemented to create a new transfer when phase 3 state already exists for the same `SUFFIX`. It does not repair a failed transfer.

### Issue: EDR is not found after transfer start

**Symptom**

Phase 3 reports that no resolvable EDR was found.

**Likely cause**

- The EDR has not been materialized yet.
- The transfer ID does not belong to the current run.
- Consumer access or connector state is invalid.

**Checks**

Review:

```text
evidencias/runs/${SUFFIX}/phase3/30_edr_direct_*.http
evidencias/runs/${SUFFIX}/phase3/30_edr_dataaddress_redacted.json
evidencias/runs/${SUFFIX}/phase3/31_edrs_request_redacted.json
```

Phase 3 already polls direct EDR retrieval up to 20 times with three-second intervals and then tries its implemented EDR-list fallback.

**Corrective action**

If the existing transfer is still valid, rerun phase 3 with `PHASE3_RESUME=1`. The script resolves and reuses `TRANSFER_ID`, checks transfer state, polls when appropriate, and retries EDR retrieval without creating a new transfer.

Do not combine `PHASE3_RESUME=1` with `PHASE3_FORCE=1`; the script rejects that combination.

### Issue: phase 3 refuses to run because transfer state exists

**Symptom**

The script reports that `phase3_env.sh` already contains `TRANSFER_ID`.

**Likely cause**

Duplicate-transfer protection detected prior phase 3 state for the same run.

**Checks**

Review the existing transfer state and whether the EDR step completed.

**Corrective action**

- Use the existing `phase3_env.sh` and continue to phase 4 when phase 3 is `ok`.
- Use `PHASE3_RESUME=1` to continue the existing transfer after an EDR-stage failure.
- Use `PHASE3_FORCE=1` only when a deliberate new transfer is required.

These controls are mutually exclusive where the script enforces it and do not delete prior connector state.

## Phase 4: download and manifest

### Issue: phase 4 reports a failed prerequisite

**Symptom**

Phase 4 reports missing phase 3 state or `phases.phase3.status != ok`.

**Likely cause**

Phase 3 did not complete, or the wrong `phase3_env.sh` is loaded.

**Checks**

```bash
: "${SUFFIX:?Source phase3_env.sh}"
jq -r '.phases.phase3.status' "evidencias/runs/${SUFFIX}/summary.json"
printf 'transfer=%s\n' "${TRANSFER_ID:-<unset>}"
```

**Corrective action**

Complete or resume phase 3 first. Phase 4 requires matching `SUFFIX`, `ASSET_ID`, `AGREEMENT_ID`, and `TRANSFER_ID`.

### Issue: EDR is missing or expired in phase 4

**Symptom**

Phase 4 cannot resolve a current EDR even though phase 3 previously succeeded.

**Likely cause**

- The EDR is not currently available.
- The transfer ID or sourced phase state is stale.
- Consumer authentication or connector state is invalid.

**Checks**

Review phase 4 EDR status and redacted diagnostics:

```text
evidencias/runs/${SUFFIX}/phase4/30_edr_direct_*.http
evidencias/runs/${SUFFIX}/phase4/30_edr_dataaddress_redacted.json
evidencias/runs/${SUFFIX}/phase4/31_edrs_request_redacted.json
```

Phase 4 automatically re-authenticates the consumer, polls direct EDR retrieval up to 20 times with three-second intervals, and uses its implemented EDR-list fallback.

**Corrective action**

First rerun phase 4 with the correct `phase3_env.sh`; this invokes the implemented EDR re-fetch. If the transfer itself is not valid, return to phase 3 and use `PHASE3_RESUME=1` only when its documented preconditions hold.

### Issue: all Data Plane authorization attempts fail

**Symptom**

Phase 4 reports that it could not consume the EDR endpoint.

**Likely cause**

- EDR authorization is no longer valid.
- Data Plane or upstream access fails.
- The response is empty, non-successful, or invalid JSON for a JSON asset.

**Checks**

Inspect:

```text
evidencias/runs/${SUFFIX}/phase4/42_data_attempts_summary.json
evidencias/runs/${SUFFIX}/phase4/40_data_response_attempt_*.http
```

The current observed valid authorization representation is handled internally as `authorization_raw`. Other candidates are compatibility fallbacks implemented by the script.

**Corrective action**

Correct transfer, EDR, Data Plane, or upstream availability and rerun phase 4. Do not extract raw authorization or manually reproduce the candidate loop.

### Issue: manifest is missing

**Symptom**

The download may exist, but the run-specific manifest or `phase4/save_download` summary step is absent.

**Likely cause**

- Phase 4 failed after receiving data but before terminal completion.
- Content validation failed.
- Local copy or hashing failed.

**Checks**

```bash
: "${SUFFIX:?Source phase3_env.sh}"
jq '.phases.phase4' "evidencias/runs/${SUFFIX}/summary.json"
test -f "downloads/manifests/${ASSET_ID}/${SUFFIX}.manifest.json"
```

**Corrective action**

Treat the run as incomplete. Resolve the recorded phase 4 failure and rerun phase 4. Do not create a manifest by hand.

### Issue: downloaded JSON is invalid or unexpected

**Symptom**

HTTP status is successful, but phase 4 rejects JSON syntax or the flow guide's semantic check fails.

**Likely cause**

- Upstream returned HTML, XML, an error object, or truncated content.
- The wrong asset configuration was published.
- The response is valid JSON but not the expected domain structure.

**Checks**

```bash
download_file="downloads/assets/${ASSET_ID}/${SUFFIX}.${ASSET_EXTENSION:-json}"
test -s "${download_file}"
jq empty "${download_file}"
```

Then run the semantic `jq` check from the selected flow guide.

**Corrective action**

Correct the upstream request or publish a new asset with the correct immutable data address. HTTP 200 alone is not acceptance.

### Issue: a run-specific download already exists with different content

**Symptom**

Phase 4 refuses to overwrite the destination and requests `DOWNLOAD_FORCE=1`.

**Likely cause**

The same `SUFFIX` and asset destination already contain bytes with a different SHA-256.

**Checks**

Compare the intended run, asset ID, existing run-specific manifest, byte count, and hash metadata.

**Corrective action**

If replacement is deliberate and the run identity is correct, rerun phase 4 with `DOWNLOAD_FORCE=1`. The implemented behavior is:

- create the run-specific file when absent;
- leave it unchanged when the existing hash matches;
- reject a different hash unless `DOWNLOAD_FORCE=1`;
- update mutable `latest.*` from the accepted run-specific file.

`DOWNLOAD_FORCE` is overwrite permission, not a retry or connector cleanup mechanism.

## Ingestion API

### Issue: phase 1 reports a missing API key

**Symptom**

Phase 1 requires `INGESTA_API_KEY`.

**Likely cause**

The ignored Ingestion API environment was not sourced immediately before phase 1.

**Checks**

Confirm the local file exists without printing its values:

```bash
test -f data/real/ingesta/auth/ingesta_api_key.env
```

**Corrective action**

Follow the [Ingestion API flow](flows/ingestion-api.md): source the ignored file immediately before phase 1, run phase 1, then unset `INGESTA_API_KEY` and `INGESTA_API_PROVIDER_ID` before phase 2.

### Issue: provider ID is missing or non-numeric

**Symptom**

Phase 1 reports that `INGESTA_API_PROVIDER_ID` is required or must be numeric.

**Likely cause**

The variable is absent, contains a header prefix, or contains an identity-system identifier rather than the upstream application's numeric provider ID.

**Checks**

```bash
if [[ "${INGESTA_API_PROVIDER_ID:-}" =~ ^[0-9]+$ ]]; then
  echo "provider ID format: numeric"
else
  echo "provider ID format: invalid"
fi
```

**Corrective action**

Obtain the numeric provider ID from the upstream resource owner and update the ignored local environment. Do not publish or log it unnecessarily.

### Issue: Ingestion phase 4 returns an upstream authorization failure

**Symptom**

The EDR is resolved, but the upstream response is unauthorized, empty, or invalid JSON.

**Likely cause**

The provider asset was published with a missing, invalid, or rotated API key/provider ID.

**Checks**

- Review phase 1 redacted data-address evidence.
- Review phase 4 HTTP status and attempt summary.
- Optionally run the separate direct preflight documented in the flow guide.

**Corrective action**

Correct the provider-side secret and publish a new asset. The provider data address is immutable for this assessment. Run phase 4 normally; do not add the upstream key to the consumer environment.

## WFS

### Issue: WFS response is not expected GeoJSON

**Symptom**

The response is empty, invalid JSON, or valid JSON without the expected GeoJSON `FeatureCollection`.

**Likely cause**

- Upstream WFS is unavailable.
- Wrong layer or request format.
- Upstream returned an XML/HTML error document or an application error object.

**Checks**

```bash
download_file="downloads/assets/${ASSET_ID}/${SUFFIX}.json"
jq -e '
  type == "object"
  and .type == "FeatureCollection"
  and (.features | type == "array")
' "${download_file}"
```

**Corrective action**

Select the validated city or district-board configuration required by the integration and publish a new asset if the data address was wrong. Do not accept HTTP 200 or generic JSON as GeoJSON proof.

## SPARQL

### Issue: SPARQL returns XML instead of SPARQL Results JSON

**Symptom**

The request returns HTTP 200, but `jq` rejects the body or the content is XML.

**Likely cause**

A legacy/noncanonical configuration omitted the explicit SPARQL Results JSON format.

**Checks**

Confirm:

```text
ASSET_CONFIG=asset_configs/real/consumo/sparql/emisiones_sparql_limit10_format_json.json
```

Validate the local download:

```bash
download_file="downloads/assets/${ASSET_ID}/${SUFFIX}.json"
jq -e '
  type == "object"
  and (.head | type == "object")
  and (.results | type == "object")
  and (.results.bindings | type == "array")
' "${download_file}"
```

**Corrective action**

Use the canonical JSON-format configuration and publish a new asset. Do not relabel XML as JSON and do not treat HTTP 200 as content validation.

### Issue: SPARQL JSON has the wrong structure

**Symptom**

`jq empty` succeeds, but `head` or `results.bindings` is absent.

**Likely cause**

The upstream returned a generic JSON error, the encoded query is wrong, or a different API response was published.

**Checks**

Run the structural check from the [SPARQL flow](flows/sparql.md) and review only the local authorized result.

**Corrective action**

Validate query and result format together, then publish a new asset with the corrected immutable data address.

## Evidence and secret handling

### Issue: a secret is detected in evidence

**Symptom**

A script redaction assertion or evidence scan detects a password, token-like value, API-key value, EDR authorization, client secret, storage credential, or sensitive URL.

**Likely cause**

- A raw response or temporary request was copied into evidence.
- A new credential field is not covered by the expected redaction path.
- A local credential file was included in a package.

**Checks**

Stop publication. Identify the affected file without printing the value. Check whether it is:

- a phase environment;
- a sensitive/secret-named artifact;
- a raw request body;
- a local credential file;
- an unredacted JSON field.

**Corrective action**

Remove the artifact from any package or shared location, rotate the credential if disclosure occurred, correct the generation/redaction process, and regenerate evidence. Do not hand-edit a leaked public package and assume the secret is safe.

See [Evidence and traceability](evidence-and-traceability.md) and [Authentication](authentication.md).

### Issue: `latest.json` does not identify the intended run

**Symptom**

The current convenience download contains data from a newer execution than expected.

**Likely cause**

`latest.*` was updated by another successful phase 4 run.

**Checks**

Use the run-specific manifest and download:

```text
downloads/assets/${ASSET_ID}/${SUFFIX}.${ASSET_EXTENSION}
downloads/manifests/${ASSET_ID}/${SUFFIX}.manifest.json
```

**Corrective action**

Use asset ID, `SUFFIX`, run-specific paths, and manifest metadata for durable traceability. Do not use `latest.*` as a backend contract or historical identifier.

## Legacy and historical boundaries

- `v1` is legacy-supported and not the recommended path.
- B2/CSV/InesDataStore is preserved as delivered T1 baseline evidence; its `phase*b` procedures are not part of this active guide.
- `test3`, flat pre-versioned flow paths, upstream JWT authentication, phase 3 inline download, and old workshop steps are historical or obsolete.

Historical procedures are intentionally not repaired or merged here. Use [Evidence and traceability](evidence-and-traceability.md) for the T1–T4 classification.
